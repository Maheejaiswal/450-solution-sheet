# Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively. The task is to find union between these two arrays.
## 1st Approach
```
def doUnion(self,a,n,b,m):
  l=set(a+b)
  return len(l)
```
## 2nd Approach
```
def doUnion(self,a,n,b,m):
    final_list = list(set(a)|set(b))
    return len(final_list)
```
